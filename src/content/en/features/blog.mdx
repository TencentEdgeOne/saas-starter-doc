# Content Management

## Local Content Management
The project supports direct local content management, using markdown files for blog and case content management.

### Blog Posts
Create new blog posts in `content/blog/`, with an introduction:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
excerpt: "Your article brief description"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["SaaS", "Next.js", "Tutorial"]
readTime: "5 minutes read"
---

# Your blog post content

Write your content here using Markdown...
```

### Case Studies
Create new case studies in `content/cases/`:
```markdown
---
title: "Case Title"
description: "Case description"
image: "/images/cases/case1.png"
externalUrl: "https://example.com"
tags: ["AI", "Music", "Creativity"]
---

```

## CMS Integration
> To facilitate management and collaboration, the project also supports pulling CMS data, currently only supporting Contentful CMS content integration, with more common CMS support to come.
